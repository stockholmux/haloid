# Haloid

Put together a sick web application with the best stuff:

* Data Storage with [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* Authentication with [Passwordless](https://passwordless.net/)

All built on top of [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/)

##Why?

Nothing quite fit my needs - I had no desire to build another web application with username/password authentication and I wanted to use the speed of Redis. I wanted to, without much boilerplate, create a website with both a public and private facing side. I also needed the ability to quickly implement admin features. Finally, I wanted something that allowed a mostly functional-style of programming.

##How?
See our example site (coming soon) and read the [docs](https://github.com/stockholmux/haloid/blob/master/README.md).
